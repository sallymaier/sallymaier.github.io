      <h2>
        This course provides extended
        study of graphic design
        principles and their application
        to more complex and
        comprehensive solutions.
        Experimentation, research,
        conceptual thinking, and
        process are emphasized in
        design for the screen. Students
        learn essential design
        tools and techniques for the
        development of interactive
        media. Students work with
        html and css to understand
        code as a fundamental building
        block for their design
        compositions. Prerequisite:
        GD 200 (Graphic Design 1).

    <h5>Class Meetings</h5>
    <p>Classes will consist of
        critiques, presentations,
        demonstrations, work sessions,
        and discussion. We
        will meet as a large group,
        in small groups, and in
        individual meetings at different
        points in the semester.
        Generally class will be
        treated as structured work
        time where feedback and help
        are readily available. You
        should always be prepared to
        work on the current project
        (or short in class assignments)
        whenever we meet,
        as well as to show progress
        each session.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-3">
      <h5>Attendance</h5>
      <p>Students are expected to
        attend all meetings of each
        class in which they are enrolled.
        Unexcused absences
        from as few as three classes
        in a three-credit course
        will result in a failing
        grade.</p>
      <p>
        An unexcused absence
        on a critique day signifigantly lower your grade for that project.</p>
      <p>
        Excused absences are the
        following and must be documented:
        personal illness,
        court appearance, death in
        the family; email as soon as
        you know you will be missing
        class. You are responsible
        for any material missed,
        do not expect me to recap.
        If you miss a critique day,
        your work is due at the next
        earliest possible date. Use
        your good judgment and get
        me your materials as soon as
        is possible. If they aren’t
        turned in by the following
        week’s class meeting, you’ll
        begin to lose a letter grade
        per week late.</p>

      
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-3">
    <h5>Work and Critiques</h5>
    <p>If you are having difficulty understanding an assignment or
    completing your work, contact me right away.</p>
    <p>Be prepared for class every day that we meet. Please bring
    all the necessary tools, files, and sketches to work in class.
    You must meet all project deadlines. Technical problems are not an excuse. Late work will
    automatically lower your grade.</p>
    <p>If you have not finished work for a critique, come to class anyway to at least engage the
    discussion. Your assignment, however, will still be considered late.</p>
    <p>Work on assignments for this studio only during our class sessions; no personal email, social
    networking, phone calls, texting or chat during critiques, demos or lectures. Trust me, I see you, and this will affect your grade.</p>

    <h5>Projects</h5>
    <p>We will be completing 3 main
    projects this semester.
    Through them we will explore
    modular and systems design
    across multiple mediums and
    interaction design. The final
    design solutions will
    vary in medium and scope.
    These projects are designed
    to further your understanding
    and experience of design
    fundamentals and practice,
    while focusing on the rapid
    evolution of technology
    that continues to change
    how we communicate visually.
    I will post project
    briefs as the semester progresses
    clarifying project
    goals, deliverables and constraints.
    Most projects will
    include pre-made code to help you that
    you will be required to use.
    Save sketches and draft versions to show a progression of your work.</p>

      Bulletin: www.mica.edu/

    <h5>Americans with Disabilities Act</h5>
    <p>Any student who may need an
      accommodation based on the
      potential impact of a disability
      should contact the Learning
      Resource Center at 410-225-2416,
      in Bunting 458, to establish
      eligibility and coordinate
      reasonable accommodations.</p>
      <h5>Environmental Health and Safety (EHS)</h5>
      <p>It is the responsibility of faculty
        and students to follow health
        and safety guidelines relevant
        to their individual activities,
        processes, and to review MICA’s
        Emergency Action Plan and attend
        EHS training. It is each faculty
        member’s responsibility to
        coordinate with the EHS Office to
        ensure that all risks associated
        with their class activities are
        identified and to assure that their
        respective classroom procedures
        mirror the EHS and Academic
        Department Guidelines. Each of
        these policies and procedures
        must be followed by all students
        and faculty. Most importantly,
        faculty are to act in accordance
        with all safety compliance, state
        and federal, as employees of this
        college and are expected to act
        as examples of how to create art
        in a way to minimize risk, and
        reduce harm to themselves and the
        environment. Faculty must identify
        and require appropriate personal
        protective equipment for each art
        making process, for each student,
        in all of their classes, when
        applicable. Students are required
        to purchase personal protection
        equipment appropriate for their
        major. Those students who do not
        have the proper personal protection
        equipment will not be permitted to
        attend class until safe measures
        and personal protection are in
        place.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-3">
      <h5>Plagiarism</h5>
      <p>Each discipline within the arts has
      specific and appropriate means for
      students to cite or acknowledge
      sources and the ideas and material
      of others used in their own work.
      Students have the responsibility to
      become familiar with such processes
      and to carefully follow their use
      in developing original work.</p>
      <h5>Policy</h5>
      <p>MICA will not tolerate plagiarism,
      which is defined as claiming
      authorship of, or using someone
      else’s ideas or work without
      proper acknowledgment. Without
      proper attribution, a student may
      NOT replicate another’s work,
      paraphrase another’s ideas, or
      appropriate images in a manner
      that violates the specific rules
      against plagiarism in the student’s
      department. In addition, students
      may not submit the same work for
      credit in more than one course
      without the explicit approval of
      all of the instructors of the
      courses involved.</p>
      <h5>Consequences</h5>
      <p>When an instructor has evidence
      that a student has plagiarized
      work submitted for course credit,
      the instructor will confront the
      student and impose penalties that
      may include failing the course. In
      the case of a serious violation or
      repeated infractions from the same
      student, the instructor will report
      the infractions to the department
      chair or program director.
      Depending on the circumstances of
      the case, the department chair or
      program director may then report
      the student to the appropriate
      dean or provost, who may choose to
      impose further penalties, including
      expulsion.</p>
      <h5>Appeal Process</h5>
      <p>Students who are penalized by
      an instructor or department for
      committing plagiarism have the
      right to appeal the charge and
      penalties that ensue. Within three
      weeks of institutional action,
      the student must submit a letter
      of appeal to the department
      chairperson or program director, or
      relevant dean or provost related
      to the course for which actions
      were taken. The academic officer
      will assign three members of the
      relevant department/division to
      serve on a review panel. The panel
      will meet with the student and
      the instructor of record and will
      review all relevant and available
      materials. The panel will determine
      whether or not to confirm the
      charge and penalties. The findings
      of the panel are final. The panel
      will notify the instructor,
      the chairperson, division, the
      student, and the Office of Academic
      Affairs of their findings and any
      recommendations for change in
      penalties.</p>

    <h5>Title IX Notification</h5>
    <p>Maryland Institute College of Art
    seeks to provide an educational
    environment based on mutual respect
    that is free from discrimination
    and harassment. If you have
    encountered sexual harassment/
    misconduct/assault, please know
    that there are multiple ways to
    report it and you are encouraged
    to do so (www.mica.edu/equal_
    opportunity). Additionally, in
    order to meet our commitments to
    equity and to comply with Title
    IX of the Education Amendments
    of 1972 and guidance from the
    Office for Civil Rights, faculty
    and staff members are required
    to report disclosures of sexual
    violence made to them by students,
    except when prior notice regarding
    a specific classroom assignment
    or discussion is provided. If you
    require academic accommodations due
    to an incident involving sexual
    harassment or discrimination,
    please contact Student Affairs at
    410.225.2422 or Human Resources at
    410.225.2363.</p>
    <h5>Students with Extended Illness or Cause for Legitimate Absence</h5>
    <p>In the case of extended illness or
    other legitimate absences that may
    keep the student from attending a
    class for more than three meetings,
    students must contact the Student
    Development Specialist in the
    Division of Student Affairs so
    that instructors can be notified.
    Graduate students must contact the
    instructor, program director, and
    the Office of Graduate Studies.
    Students in art education or
    professional studies programs must
    contact the Dean for the Center
    for Art Education or the Dean of
    the School for Professional and
    Continuing Studies, respectively.
    The appropriate administrator will
    facilitate a conversation with
    faculty to determine whether the
    student can achieve satisfactory
    academic progress.</p>
