        This course provides extended
        study of graphic design
        principles and their application
        to more complex and
        comprehensive solutions.
        Experimentation, research,
        conceptual thinking, and
        process are emphasized in
        design for the screen. Students
        learn essential design
        tools and techniques for the
        development of interactive
        media. Students work with
        html and css to understand
        code as a fundamental building
        block for their design
        compositions. Prerequisite:
        GD 200 (Graphic Design 1).

    <h5>Class Meetings</h5>
    <p>Classes will consist of
        critiques, presentations,
        demonstrations, work sessions,
        and discussion. We
        will meet as a large group,
        in small groups, and in
        individual meetings at different
        points in the semester.
        Generally class will be
        treated as structured work
        time where feedback and help
        are readily available. You
        should always be prepared to
        work on the current project
        (or short in class assignments)
        whenever we meet,
        as well as to show progress
        each session.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-3">
      <h5>Attendance</h5>
      <p>Students are expected to
        attend all meetings of each
        class in which they are enrolled.
        Unexcused absences
        from as few as three classes
        in a three-credit course
        will result in a failing
        grade.</p>
      <p>
        An unexcused absence
        on a critique day signifigantly lower your grade for that project.</p>
      <p>
        Excused absences are the
        following and must be documented:
        personal illness,
        court appearance, death in
        the family; email as soon as
        you know you will be missing
        class. You are responsible
        for any material missed,
        do not expect me to recap.
        If you miss a critique day,
        your work is due at the next
        earliest possible date. Use
        your good judgment and get
        me your materials as soon as
        is possible. If they aren’t
        turned in by the following
        week’s class meeting, you’ll
        begin to lose a letter grade
        per week late.</p>

      
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-3">
    <h5>Work and Critiques</h5>
    <p>If you are having difficulty understanding an assignment or
    completing your work, contact me right away.</p>
    <p>Be prepared for class every day that we meet. Please bring
    all the necessary tools, files, and sketches to work in class.
    You must meet all project deadlines. Technical problems are not an excuse. Late work will
    automatically lower your grade.</p>
    <p>If you have not finished work for a critique, come to class anyway to at least engage the
    discussion. Your assignment, however, will still be considered late.</p>
    <p>Work on assignments for this studio only during our class sessions; no personal email, social
    networking, phone calls, texting or chat during critiques, demos or lectures. Trust me, I see you, and this will affect your grade.</p>
  </div>
</div>
  <div class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-3">
    <h5>Projects</h5>
    <p>We will be completing 3 main
projects this semester.
Through them we will explore
modular and systems design
across multiple mediums and
interaction design. The final
design solutions will
vary in medium and scope.
These projects are designed
to further your understanding
and experience of design
fundamentals and practice,
while focusing on the rapid
evolution of technology
that continues to change
how we communicate visually.
I will post project
briefs as the semester progresses
clarifying project
goals, deliverables and constraints.
Most projects will
include pre-made code to help you that
you will be required to use.
Save sketches and draft versions to show a progression of your work.</p>
